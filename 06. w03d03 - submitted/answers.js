/// Answer the Following ///

For each of the following, write which datatypes you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the data structure:

e.g. A computer that can be either on or off.
=> datatype: boolean
=> data structure example: const computer = true;


A light switch that can be either on or off.
=> datatype: boolean
=> data structure example: const light = true;

A user's email address.
=> datatype: string
=> data structure example: user@domain.com

A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
=> datatype: object
=> data structure example: const spaceship = {
    "hull": 'idk01',
    "laserBlaster": 'idk02',
    "tractorBeam": 'idk03',
    "warpDrive": 'idk04',
}

A list of student names from our class.
=> datatype: array
=> data structure example: const phoenixRising= ['Andrei', 'Chris', 'Axel']

A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
=> datatype: array of objects
=> data structure example: const phoenixRising = [
    {
    "name": 'Andrei',
    "location": 'Atlanta"
}
]

A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.
=> datatype: array of objects with an inner array
=> data structure example: const phoenixRising = [
    {
        "name": 'Andrei',
        "location": "ATLANTA",
        "favoriteTvShows": ['Mind of Mencia', 'NelkFilmz']

    }
]


//// TAKE IT EASY ////

Make an array that holds all of the colors of the rainbow.
const rainbow = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];

Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.
Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.
