## Hungry for more

Create a button to render a fresh taco

Create a form and find more specific tacos, research the [api](https://github.com/evz/tacofancy-api)

Style away!

Have a random taco load on page load?

## Bonus: The Return of OMDB

- Make a new OMDB app that queries using the `s=` query (we used `t=` in the lesson). Rather than returning one movie with a bunch of details, it will return a list of closely matching movies.

- Render the list (note the data will be different, you'll have to look through it and figure out the keys and values)

- Bonus! On clicking one of the list of movies, have it do a `t=` search, and render the individual view that you got from lesson.
