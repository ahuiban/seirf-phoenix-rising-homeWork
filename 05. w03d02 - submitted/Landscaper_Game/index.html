            <h4>You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth. Using just your teeth, you can
                spend the day cutting lawns and make $1. At any point, if you are currently using your teeth, you can
                buy a pair of rusty scissors for $5. Using the rusty scissors, you can spend the day cutting lawns and
                make $5. At any point, if you are currently using rusty scissors, you can buy an old-timey push
                lawnmower for $25. Using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $50.
                At any point, if you are currently using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can buy a fancy
                battery-powered lawnmower for $250. Using the the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can spend the day
                cutting lawns and make $100. At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered
                lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500. Using the the team of starving students,
                you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $250. You win the game when you have a team of starving
                students and $1000.
